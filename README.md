# AoE4_ObserverUI

A game mode for Age of Empires IV with the sole purpose of improving the UI seen during replays and while observing games.

Due to the nature of the tool currently used by bigger tournaments and streamers it has to be closed source and cannot be distributed freely. With the official Content Editor there are now other means to improve the UI that do not require secrecy but also suffer from their own limitations.

-Updating a mod breaks all replays of games played with that mod
-You cannot decide on using the improved UI after the game is played, the mod has to be included when the game is started
-Thus the improved UI cannot be used for ranked play or quick matches, only for custom games
